# Duvet
The goal of this project is to emulate functions of the human brain.
To emulate the brain functions, we use the concept of the "cell".
(The cell concept may change later on.)
Cells gather and form a group which has a special function.
The ultimate goal is to use the result of this project in a bigger
project, which has the goal of emulating a human brain.
Plans and details are all recorded in docs.

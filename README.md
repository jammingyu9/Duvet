The goal of this project is to emulate the human brain.
Important design concepts are

1) Existence, not purpose.

2) Adapts many biological facts.

This program emulates basic signal handling system, which its core
function is to receive, translate, make decisions, and trasmit 
the signals from and to anonymous cells.

I focus to build an entity that has a free will and
that can live by itself in the future.

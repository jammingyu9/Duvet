# Duvet
This project constructs any meaningful group.
The building block of a group is "cell",
which later will be changed to a more general concept.
Cells gather and form a group which has a special function.
The purpose of generating these groups are to explore if 
in short term: we can emulate the concept of cells(like animal organs)
in long term: we can emulate the concept of particles(the building blocks of the nature)
